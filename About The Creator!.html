        I am an aspiring Software Developer! I live in Chicago, Illinois where I was born and raised. Some of my hobbies are coding, learning, and playing video games. I am currently a college student at DeVry Institute of Technology where I am studying Software Design and Programming. I also have completed my Associate Degree with DeVry as a Network Administrator. I am currently enrolled in a variety of programs to help me understand a variety of languages including Northwestern University (Full-Stack Web Development), Code Academy (Python Development), Free Code Camp (Full-Stack Web Development), Code Gym (Java Development), Coding Dojo (Java Development), and more. I also have a large background in cloud technologies such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure (Microsoft), and GCP (Google Cloud Platform). I cannot wait to gain a better understanding of how all these different technologies tie in with one another in an enterprise environment, and hopefully some day soon I'll get a role with the title Software Developer!
