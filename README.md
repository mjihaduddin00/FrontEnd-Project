# FrontEnd-Project
This is my project submission where I was tasked to create a site that utilizes multiple API's, frameworks, and is overall user-friendly. This project that I have created uses four API's (weather, location, COVID-19, and news API), the Bootstrap Framework, the jQuery Framework, the Google Cloud Platform, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more to deliver an all in one location to access general, but necessary, information. During the delivery of this project, I used the Scrum Framework, Kanban Framework, and Agile Principles to successfully deliver a product that fulfilled all requirements for the end-user.

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/FrontEnd-Project/

Thanks!

Issue(s):

- The news API is not working due to the browser not being secure (HTTP instead of the HTTPS it is requesting). However, I have uploaded a screenshot(s) of the news API functioning on my local machine to prove the API functionality of it. The screenshot(s) is listed in the uploaded files under the folder "Functioning News API."

- The API key from the Google Cloud Platform can temporarily receive requests from any website as of the moment to show functionality, but this will be rid of soon as this can cause a large billing estimate. The GCP API will be limited to use only when displaying API functionality in the future.
