# FrontEnd-Project
This is my project submission where I was tasked to create a site that utilizes multiple API's, frameworks, and is overall user-friendly. This project that I have created uses four API's (weather, location, COVID-19, and news API), the Bootstrap Framework, the jQuery Framework, the Google Cloud Platform, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more to deliver an all in one location to access general, but necessary, information. During the delivery of this project, I used the Scrum Framework, Kanban Framework, and Agile Principles to successfully deliver a product that fulfilled all requirements for the end-user.
